# NeuroKey-Embedded
Course project (EEL3090) using an STM32 board, We will create a voice recognition system that does keyword spotting on an STM32 Nucleo-L476RG board. Using AI and embedded technologies for real-time keyword recognition. It shows how embedded neural networks can be used in smart assistants, industrial automation, and healthcare monitoring.
